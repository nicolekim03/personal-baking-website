            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>An all too familiar snack for those who grew up in Korean households, Jollypong is sure a crowd favorite for many,
                considering its delicious flavor profile of honey, caramel, and even coffee! This amazing snack can be enjoyed
                as cereal with milk (similar to Honey Smacks in the US) or simply out of the bag. Growing up, I've had too many bags
                to count. What better way to experience nostalgia than to make it into a dessert that is sure to be a crowd pleaser!
            <p>My Jollypong cupcakes are fluffy and moist chocolate cake topped with an espresso infused buttercream, then drizzled with
                caramel and crushed Jollypong.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup canola oil</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 cup sugar</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>200g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbs baking powder</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the butter over medium heat until properly browned. Let cool.</li>
                    <li>Combine browned butter and both sugars in a stand mixer. 
                        Once combined, beat in the eggs and vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to 
                        the wet ingredients slowly until just incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Fold in the chopped chocolate bars. Careful not to overmix.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours. This would be a great 
                        time to pre-scoop the dough while it's soft.</li>
                    <li>With the oven set to 350Â°F, lay the dough balls out on a sheet pan
                        lined with parchment and sprinkle some flaky sea salt. Bake for 
                        11 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are golden.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
