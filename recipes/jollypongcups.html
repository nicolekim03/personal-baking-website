            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>An all too familiar snack for those who grew up in Korean households, Jollypong is sure a crowd favorite for many,
                considering its delicious flavor profile of honey, caramel, and even coffee! This amazing snack can be enjoyed
                as cereal with milk (similar to Honey Smacks in the US) or simply out of the bag. Growing up, I've had too many bags
                to count. What better way to experience nostalgia than to make it into a dessert that is sure to be a crowd pleaser!
            <p>My Jollypong cupcakes are fluffy and moist chocolate cake topped with an espresso infused buttercream, then drizzled with
                caramel and crushed Jollypong.</p>

            <!-- once learned, change subheadings for each part into diff color and font maybe? -->
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and line a cupcake pan with cupcake liners.</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the instant espresso into the warm water.</li>
                    <li>Add melted dark chocolate chips and cocoa powder, whisking until combined.</li>
                    <li>Add eggs, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, and vinegar. Whisk until combined.</li>
                    <li>Sift the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, and salt, into the bowl. Mix until combined.</li>
                    <li>Scoop the batter into the cupcake liners, making sure only to fill it up to 2/3 full.</li>
                    <li>Bake the cupcakes for 15-17 minutes. Turn the pan halfway if your oven distributes heat unevenly.</li>
                    <li>Take the cupcakes out of the oven and let them cool in the pan for a couple of minutes. 
                        After, you can place them on a wire rack to fully cool.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Espresso Swiss-Meringue Buttercream</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine the instant espresso with some warm milk. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>In a medium, heat-resistant bowl, add in the egg whites and sugar. Whisk until uniform.</li>
                    <li>Place the bowl over a pot with some water and place the pot on a stovetop. This will act
                         as your double boiler.</li>
                    <li>Turn on the heat to medium-high and whisk the mixture as it boils. Heat until either the
                        mixture reaches 240°F or you no longer feel sugar granules.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix on high until a meringue forms.</li>
                    <li>Slowly incorporate the butter in pieces. Once fully incorporated, mix for another 5-10 minutes
                        until you get a smooth buttercream.
                    </li>Add in the coffee mixture and vanilla. Beat until incorporated and fluffy.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Caramel Sauce</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a heavy bottomed pan, heat the sugar on medium-low until it has dissolved. Gently
                        swish the pan to help the sugar heat evenly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the sugar has melted completely, take the pan off the heat and slowly incorporate the butter
                        with a whisk. Careful as the sugar with bubble up and get very hot!
                    </li>
                    <li>After the butter has been combined in with the sugar, pour the heavy cream in along with the salt. Mix well.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Assembling Everything</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grab your desired piping bag with your desired piping tip and scoop some of the buttercream in.</li>
                    <li>Pipe your cupcakes.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle the caramel on top of the piped cupcakes with your desired method. I chose to pour some of the caramel
                        into a Ziploc bag and use it as a piping bag!
                    </li>
                    <li>Top off the cupcakes with some crumbled Jollypong and enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
