        <h1>Swiss-Meringue Buttercream</h1>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Fluffy yet silky buttercream with just the right touch of sweetness, this is my personal favorite
                Swiss-meringue buttercream. This buttercream can be used for something like piping cupcakes 
                (which it does absolutely perfectly!) or piping your favorite macarons! As intimidating the name 
                may seem to those unfamiliar with making anything other than American buttercream or purchasing 
                premade icing (no judgement here, I often think about purchasing a container myself sometimes!),
                this recipe is sure to surprise you with how easy it can be to make bakery quality buttercream!</p>
       
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 large egg whites</li>
                    <li>175g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>200g room temperature unsalted butter, preferably high quality</li>
                    <li>1 tbs pure vanilla extract, optional</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt, optional</li>
                </ul>
                
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium, heat-resistant bowl, add in the egg whites and sugar. Whisk until uniform.</li>
                    <li>Place the bowl over a pot with some water and place the pot on a stovetop. This will act
                         as your double boiler.</li>
                    <li>Turn on the heat to medium-high and whisk the mixture as it boils. Heat until either the
                        mixture reaches 240Â°F or you no longer feel sugar granules.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour the mixture into a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Mix on high until a meringue forms.</li>
                    <li>Slowly incorporate the butter in pieces. Once fully incorporated, mix for another 5-10 minutes
                        until you get a smooth buttercream. </li>
                    <li>Enjoy with your favorite cupcake recipe or even cookie recipe!</li>
                </ol>
