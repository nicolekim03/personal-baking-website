            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>175g unsalted butter, preferably high quality</li>
                    <li>200g brown sugar</li>
                    <li>50g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 egg & 1 egg yolk, both at room temperature</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>220g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 chocolate bars, one dark and one semi-sweet</li>
                    <li>flaky sea salt for sprinkling</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the butter over medium heat until properly browned. Let cool.</li>
                    <li>Combine browned butter and both sugars in a stand mixer. 
                        Once combined, beat in the eggs and vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to 
                        the wet ingredients slowly until just incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Fold in the chopped chocolate bars. Careful not to overmix.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate the dough for at least 2 hours. This would be a great 
                        time to pre-scoop the dough while it's soft.</li>
                    <li>With the oven set to 350Â°F, lay the dough balls out on a sheet pan
                        lined with parchment and sprinkle some flaky sea salt. Bake for 
                        11 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are golden.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
